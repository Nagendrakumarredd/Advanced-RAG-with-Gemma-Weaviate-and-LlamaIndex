# Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Gemma, Weaviate, and LlamaIndex. The RAG system enhances natural language understanding and response generation by integrating semantic search and powerful language models.

# Features
 Semantic Search: Utilizes Weaviate for efficient and accurate semantic search capabilities.  
 
 Language Generation: Employs LlamaIndex for generating coherent and contextually relevant responses.  
 
 Integration with Gemma: Seamlessly integrates with the Gemma framework to enhance the system's functionality.  
 
 Advanced Retrieval: Combines retrieval-based and generative models for improved response quality.

# Architecture
The system architecture is designed to combine the strengths of semantic search and language generation:

 Query Processing: User queries are processed and transformed into vector representations.  
 
 Semantic Search: Weaviate performs a semantic search to retrieve relevant documents based on the query vectors.  
 
 Response Generation: LlamaIndex generates responses by leveraging the retrieved documents.  
 
 Integration: The entire workflow is integrated within the Gemma framework for seamless execution.

# Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
# Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Nagendrakumarredd/Advanced-RAG-with-Gemma-Weaviate-and-LlamaIndex.git
cd Advanced-RAG-with-Gemma-Weaviate-and-LlamaIndex
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Start Weaviate: Ensure Weaviate is running locally or on a remote server.

Run the Application: Execute the main script to start the RAG system:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Interact with the System: Use the provided interface or API to send queries and receive responses.

# Configuration
Configuration settings for the system are managed through a configuration file (config.yaml). Update the configuration file with appropriate settings for Weaviate, LlamaIndex, and Gemma.

# Examples
Here are some example queries and their responses to showcase the system's capabilities:

Example Query 1:

Query: "Tell me about the history of machine learning."
Response: "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves the development of algorithms..."
Example Query 2:

Query: "What are the applications of reinforcement learning?"
Response: "Reinforcement learning has numerous applications including robotics, game playing, and autonomous driving..."
